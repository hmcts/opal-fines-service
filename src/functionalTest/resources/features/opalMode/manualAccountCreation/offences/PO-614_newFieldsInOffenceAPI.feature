  @Opal @PO-614
  Scenario: Checking additional columns are presented in the Offence API
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
    When I make a request to the offence ref data api filtering by cjs code "AA06001"
    Then the response contains the below offence data fields and values
      | offence_id        | 45010                                                                                                      |
