  Scenario: Patch draft account - Pending - happy path
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
    When I create a draft account with the following details
      | business_unit_id  | 73                                          |
      | account           | draftAccounts/accountJson/adultAccount.json |
      | account_type      | Fine                                        |
      | account_status    | Submitted                                   |

      | timeline_data     | draftAccounts/timelineJson/default.json     |

    Then The draft account response returns 201
    And I store the created draft account ID

      | version            | 0                           |

    Then The draft account response returns 200

    Then I get the single created draft account and the response contains
      | business_unit_id                    | 73                   |
