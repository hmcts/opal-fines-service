Feature: Draft account deletion by API

 Scenario: Delete the just-created draft account with concurrency control
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
    When I create a draft account with the following details
      | business_unit_id  | 73                                          |
      | account           | draftAccounts/accountJson/adultAccount.json |
      | account_type      | Fines                                       |
      | account_status    | Submitted                                   |
      | submitted_by      | BUUID                                       |
      | submitted_by_name | Laura Clerk                                 |
    And I store the created draft account ID

    Then I delete the last created draft account using concurrency control

  Scenario: Cleanup should not fail if the account is already gone
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
    When I create a draft account with the following details
      | business_unit_id  | 73                                          |
      | account           | draftAccounts/accountJson/adultAccount.json |
      | account_type      | Fines                                       |
      | account_status    | Submitted                                   |
      | submitted_by      | BUUID                                       |
      | submitted_by_name | Laura Clerk                                 |
    And I store the created draft account ID

    # Delete it once (should remove it)
    When I delete the last created draft account using concurrency control

    # Try deleting again, but tolerate 404 by setting ignore_missing=true
    When I delete the last created draft account ignoring missing resource
