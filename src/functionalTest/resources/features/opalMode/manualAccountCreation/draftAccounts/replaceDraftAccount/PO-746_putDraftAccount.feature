  Scenario: Update draft account - update account details
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
    When I create a draft account with the following details
      | business_unit_id  | 73                                     |
      | account           | draftAccounts/accountJson/account.json |
      | account_type      | Fine                                   |
      | account_status    | Submitted                              |
      | submitted_by      | BUUID                                  |
      | submitted_by_name | Laura Clerk                            |
      | timeline_data     | draftAccounts/timelineJson/default.json|
    Then The draft account response returns 201
    And I store the created draft account ID
    And I store the created draft account created_at time
    And I store the created draft account initial account_status_date

    And The draft account response contains the following data
      | business_unit_id                    | 73          |
      | account_type                        | Fine        |
      | account_status                      | Submitted   |
      | account_snapshot.defendant_name     | null, null  |
      | account_snapshot.date_of_birth      |             |
      | account_snapshot.account_type       | Fine        |
      | account_snapshot.submitted_by       | BUUID       |
      | account_snapshot.business_unit_name | West London |

    When I update the draft account that was just created with the following details
      | business_unit_id  | 73                                          |
      | account           | draftAccounts/accountJson/adultAccount.json |
      | account_type      | Fine                                        |
      | account_status    | Submitted                                   |
      | submitted_by      | BUUID                                       |
      | submitted_by_name | Laura Clerk                                 |
      | timeline_data     | draftAccounts/timelineJson/default.json     |
      | If-Match          | 0                                           |

    Then The draft account response returns 200


    And I get the single created draft account and the response contains
      | business_unit_id                    | 73                   |
      | account_type                        | Fine                 |
      | account_status                      | Resubmitted          |
      | account_snapshot.defendant_name     | LNAME, FNAME         |
      | account_snapshot.date_of_birth      | 2000-01-01           |
      | account_snapshot.account_type       | Fine                 |
      | account_snapshot.submitted_by       | BUUID                |
      | account_snapshot.business_unit_name | West London          |

    Then I see the created at time hasn't changed
    And I see the account status date is now after the initial account status date

    Then I delete the created draft accounts
