  Scenario: Get Draft Account - No Permission
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
    When I create a draft account with the following details
      | business_unit_id  | 73                                          |
      | account           | draftAccounts/accountJson/adultAccount.json |
      | account_type      | Fine                                        |
      | account_status    | Submitted                                   |

      | timeline_data     | draftAccounts/timelineJson/default.json     |
    Then The draft account response returns 201
    And I store the created draft account ID

    Given I am testing as the "opal-test-2@hmcts.net" user
    Then I get the single created draft account and the response contains
      | business_unit_id                    |  |
      | account_type                        |  |
      | account_status                      |  |
      | account_snapshot.defendant_name     |  |
      | account_snapshot.date_of_birth      |  |
      | account_snapshot.account_type       |  |
      | account_snapshot.submitted_by       |  |
      | account_snapshot.business_unit_name |  |
    Then The draft account response returns 403
    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user

    Then I delete the created draft accounts
