      | account_type      | Fine                                        |
      | account_status    |                                             |

    When I get the draft accounts filtering on Not Submitted by "BUUID" then the response contains
      | account_snapshot.submitted_by | BUUID_TWO, BUUID_Updated |
    And The draft account filtered response does not contain accounts submitted by "BUUID"
