#  Scenario: authorised user can make the request
#    Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
#    When I make a call to the defendant search API using the parameters
#      | forename    | Smart          |
#      | surname     | John           |

#      | dayOfMonth  | 23             |
#      | monthOfYear | 11             |
#      | year        | 1999           |
#      | addressLine | 10 Brooks Lake |
#    Then there is one result returned matching
