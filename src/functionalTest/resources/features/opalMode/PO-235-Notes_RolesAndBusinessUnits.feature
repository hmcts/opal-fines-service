# Feature: tests for notes business unit users/permissions for accounts dependant on business units
#
#   Scenario: A user can add a note to a business unit it is part of
#     Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
#     When I make a request to the defendant account add notes api with
#       | associated_record_id | 500000010                       |
#       | business_unit_id     | 73                              |
#       | note_text            | test roles and perms Opal user1 |
#     And the add notes response contains
#       | associated_record_id | 500000010                       |
#       | note_text            | test roles and perms Opal user1 |
#       | posted_by            | L073JG                          |
#       | posted_by_user_id    | 500000000                       |
#       | business_unit_id     | 73                              |

#     When I make a request to the defendant account add notes api with
#       | associated_record_id | 500000010                       |
#       | business_unit_id     | 77                              |
#       | note_text            | test roles and perms Opal user1 |
#     And the add notes response contains
#       | associated_record_id | 500000010                       |
#       | note_text            | test roles and perms Opal user1 |

#
#   Scenario: A user cannot add a note to a business unit it is not part of
#     Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
#     When I make a request to the defendant account add notes api with
#       | associated_record_id | 500000010                       |
#       | business_unit_id     | 24                              |
#       | note_text            | test roles and perms Opal user1 |
#     Then the add notes request is forbidden
#
#   Scenario: The business unit must be defined in the request
#     Given I am testing as the "opal-test@hmcts.net" user
#     When I make a request to the defendant account add notes api with
#       | associated_record_id | 500000010                       |
#       | note_text            | test roles and perms Opal user1 |
#     #When error logging is looked at would be good to check the error message
#     Then the add notes request is forbidden
