* MODULE      : p_create_defendant_account_unit_tests.sql
*
* DESCRIPTION : Unit tests for the stored procedure p_create_defendant_account.
*               These tests cover various scenarios to ensure the procedure
*               correctly processes defendant account creation.
*
* VERSION HISTORY:
*
* Date          Author      Version     Nature of Change
* ----------    -------     --------    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* 16/07/2025    C Cho       1.0         Unit tests for p_create_defendant_account.
* 30/07/2025    TMc         2.0         Added unit tests for p_create_defendant_parties, p_create_debtor_details, p_create_aliases, p_create_fp_offences
*                                       Aligned to version 3.0 of p_create_defendant_account
* 04/08/2025    TMc         3.0         Amended unit tests for p_create_impositions, p_get_creditor_account, p_create_minor_creditor, p_create_enforcemenets,
*                                                              p_create_account_notes, p_create_payment_terms
*                                       Added to Test 3 (Full account details)
*                                       Removed test 4 (Verify originator_type logic when fp_ticket_detail is absent). Already checked in test 1.
*                                       Aligned to version 4.0 of p_create_defendant_account
* 26/08/2025    TMc         3.1         Amended tests 2, 3 and 8B after amended payment terms logic in p_create_payment_terms
* 27/08/2025    TMc         3.2         PO-2084 - Amended test 3. FIXED_PENALTY_OFFENCES.OFFENCE_DATE is now being populated.
